GLIER Environmental Metadata System
This is a web-based Geospatial metadata system, which combined GeoNetwork, GeoServer and InterMap with web design softwares to implement powerful geospatial metadata management functions, such as interactive mapping, on-line accessing and editing geographic data and searching on local and other data catalogues based on privilege-set. 
These are some screenshots from the System below.
